===========

Robots is an experiment. The goal is a library for creating robots or objects driven by a simple AI in a simulation or game context. The AI will be created by the user with the help of the robots library.

Why?
----

Fun. Curiosity. Lack of customizabel in RPGs (e.g. Star Wars KotoR, The Elder Scrolls, ...). The idea of robots driven by a simple, rule based, user created AI doesn't seem that complicated.

Vision
------

Imagine you're playing Skyrim and you're able to create Dwermer robot companions. I know there was a plugin providing something like that - you summoned Dwermer machines that worked like a companion. Probably good enough for a game like Skyrim. But now imagine you couldn't just summon Dwermer machines but also really create them.

Another reference: Ever player Star Wars Knights of the old Republic? Ahhh, I love that game, I wish they would make a third game. You can buy a robot and equip it with different parts, like your hero can take different clothes and items. That's pretty nice already.

But now imagine you could select how the robot moves (wheels, chaines, flying, swimming) which kind of censors it has, which tools, extensions and so on. Each part adds certain abilities to the robot (e.g. wheels: rolling, arm: grabbing, camera: vision, ...).

Based on those abilities your AI can grow and change. To see what I imagin the AI should work like take a look at `AI.md`.
