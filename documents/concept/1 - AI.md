## Vision

To explain what I have in mind I will give you a couple of examples.

### 1) Fight

Lets say your robot has wheels for moving around, a camera system to see the environment, a laser module for measuring distances up to 20 meters. The camera system will detect movement in the POV, the laser module will be used to measure the distance to any moving object. If it is closer than 5 meters it will be attacked.

### 2) Companion

The robot uses its camera module to lock the player character and move along with it. It also has a module which is paired with the weapon of the player character. If that weapon is fired the robot will attack the target it was shot at.

### 3) Minecraft

The robot is programmed to look for a certain pattern in the rocks and mine the once fitting.
